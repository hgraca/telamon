# Laravel

## Foundational Context

This is a Laravel application. Package versions are in `composer.json` — abide by those versions.

This project upgraded from Laravel 10 without migrating to the new file structure. This is fine and recommended by Laravel. Follow the existing Laravel 10 structure.

### Laravel 10 Structure

- Middleware: `app/Http/Middleware/`
- Service providers: `app/Providers/`
- No `bootstrap/app.php` application configuration:
  - Middleware registration: `app/Http/Kernel.php`
  - Exception handling: `app/Exceptions/Handler.php`
  - Console commands/schedule: `app/Console/Kernel.php`
  - Rate limits: `RouteServiceProvider` or `app/Http/Kernel.php`

## Conventions

- Follow existing code conventions. Check sibling files for structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names: `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing new ones.
- If you see a test using "Pest", convert it to PHPUnit.

## Configuration

- Never call `env()` outside `config/*.php` files. Use `Config::` in application code.
- Config files live in `config/` at package root, published via `$this->publishes(...)` in the service provider's `boot()` method.

## Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (migrations, controllers, models, etc.)
- Use `php artisan list` to discover commands, `php artisan [command] --help` for parameters
- For generic PHP classes: `php artisan make:class`
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands. Pass correct `--options` for expected behavior.

## Database

- Use Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationships over raw queries.
- Prefer `Model::query()` over `DB::`.
- Prevent N+1 queries with eager loading.
- Use query builder only for very complex operations.
- Laravel 12 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`
- When modifying a column in migrations, include all previously defined attributes — otherwise they are dropped.

### Models

- Casts: use `casts()` method rather than `$casts` property. Follow existing model conventions.
- When creating new models, create factories and seeders. Check `php artisan make:model --help` for options.

### APIs

- Default to Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing routes differ — then follow existing convention.

## Controllers & Validation

- Always use Form Request classes for validation — not inline validation in controllers. Include rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests for array vs string-based validation rules.

## Authentication & Authorization

- Use Laravel's built-in features: gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.

## URL Generation

- Prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Testing

- Use model factories in tests. Check for factory custom states before manual setup.
- Faker: Use `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing `$this->faker` vs `fake()` convention.
- Use `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` for feature tests, `--unit` for unit tests. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Do Not

- Create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality
- Change application dependencies without approval
