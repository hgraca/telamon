# Create a coding quality report

1. Copy the last iteration interactions report (`pokeapi-v<iteration>/.ai/team/epics/kata/interactions.md`) to `./reports/interactions.v<iteration>.md`

2. Compare all iterations built for the epic `.ai/team/epics/kata` (the `pokeapi-v*/` folders), with special focus on the progress in the last iteration.
   Create a report in `reports/quality-report-v<iteration>.md`.
   Follow the guide `.ai/tasks/quality-report-guide.md` to produce something comparable to `.ai/tasksquality-report-example.md` so results are comparable across iterations.

3. Produce a root-cause analysis tracing each weakness in the last iteration back to specific gaps in the `.ai/` files (context, roles, workflows).
   In an analysis gap between the last iteration and a 100% grade, map the gaps with the changes applied to the skills files (`.ai/*.md`)

4. In `./reports/01-implementation_iterations_quality.md`, in the grading table, log a table row with:
    - the iteration number
    - the quality grade
    - the amount of issues addressed in this iteration
    - the amount of issues still to address to reach 100% grade

5. Commit all changes


# Implementation Quality Report Guide

Use this guide to produce comparable quality reports for code implementations.
All reports following this guide can be compared to each other and to the example in
`.ai/tasks/quality-report-example.md`.

---

## 1. Inputs Required

Before writing the report, gather for each implementation being evaluated:

1. **Source code** — all `src/` and `tests/` files
2. **Test results** — coverage percentage, PHPStan output, test pass/fail
3. **Commit history** — number of commits, commit style, per-task vs bundled
4. **Interactions report** (if available) — agent session flow, stalls, recovery actions
5. **The reference standards** — `.ai/context/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `.ai/team/workflows/IMPLEMENTATION.md`
6. **Prior iteration reports** (if this is an incremental evaluation)

---

## 2. Report Structure

Every report MUST use this structure with these exact section numbers and titles:

```markdown
# Quality Report: <scope description>

## Epic: <epic name>

---

## 1. Approach Overview
<One subsection per implementation. Describe architecture, key decisions, file counts.>

## 2. Comparison by Dimension
<Table comparing all implementations across consistent dimensions.>

## 3. Strong Points
<One subsection per implementation. Bullet list of strengths.>

## 4. Weak Points
<One subsection per implementation. Bullet list with point deductions.>

## 5. Grades
<Table with all implementations and their grades.>

## 6. Grade Justification
<Explains gaps between implementations using +/- point accounting.>

## 7. Summary
<1–3 sentences per implementation summarizing its position.>
```

### Optional Additional Sections (for iterative evaluations)

When the report covers an iteration that builds on prior work, add:

```markdown
## 8. Conclusions
<Achievements and regressions of the latest iteration.>

## 9. Root-Cause Analysis
<Traces each weakness to specific gaps in .ai/ files. Only for the latest iteration.>
```

---

## 3. How to Write Each Section

### Section 1: Approach Overview

For each implementation, write a subsection with:

1. **Title format**: `### V<N> — <Descriptive Label>` (e.g., "V12 — DeepSeek V3 0324")
2. **Architecture summary** (2–4 sentences): domain model approach, port design, CQRS usage
3. **Key differentiator** (1 sentence): what makes this iteration unique
4. **Bug handling decision**: "The team chose to **fix/preserve** the known bug"
5. **File counts**: `**Source files: X | Test files: Y | Total: Z**`

If many prior iterations exist, reference the previous report rather than repeating:
`See quality-report-v<N>.md for the full evolution from V1 through V<N>.`

### Section 2: Comparison by Dimension

Use a markdown table. The left column is the dimension name, subsequent columns are implementations.

**Required dimensions** (include all that apply):

| Category | Dimensions to evaluate |
|----------|----------------------|
| Domain | Domain richness, Bug handling, Level calc location |
| Ports | Port design, Port DTO typing |
| Application | CQRS/Message-bus, Application DTO |
| Infrastructure | Infrastructure test strategy, Input validation, URL safety, Defensive infrastructure |
| Testing | Test coverage, Test directory split, Named test doubles, End-to-end smoke test |
| Code style | FQN usage, `assert()` usage, Classes `final`, Dead production code |
| Process | Commits, Developer session stalls, Reviewer invocations |
| Metadata | Composer metadata, Output formatting, LLM used |

Include only dimensions where at least one implementation differs from another.
Use **bold** to highlight the latest iteration's values.

### Section 3: Strong Points

For each implementation, list 4–8 bullet points. Each bullet:

- Starts with a **bold label** (2–4 words)
- Explains what was done well
- Explains why it matters (what failure it prevents or what quality it enables)

Example:
```markdown
- **100% line coverage** (122/122 lines): Achieved through targeted gap-closure tests,
  covering all defensive branches in HTTP adapters.
```

### Section 4: Weak Points

For each implementation, list all weaknesses. Each bullet:

- Starts with a **bold label**
- Includes a **point deduction** in parentheses: `(-X.XX)`
- References the specific rule or standard violated
- States the observable symptom

Example:
```markdown
- **FQN in test code** (-0.5): 8 occurrences of `\InvalidArgumentException`.
  ARCHITECTURE.md states: "We import classes whenever possible...
  This applies to both production and test code."
```

### Section 5: Grades

Use a simple two-column table:

```markdown
| Solution   | Grade            |
|------------|------------------|
| **V1**     | **73 / 100**     |
| **V2**     | **68 / 100**     |
```

Include ALL iterations ever evaluated (carry forward from prior reports).

### Section 6: Grade Justification

Compare adjacent iterations or the most recent against the prior best. Structure:

```markdown
### V<N> vs V<M> (V<N>: XX.XX, V<M>: YY.YY — Z-point gap)

**V<N> weaknesses that V<M> doesn't have (-Z total):**
1. **<Label>** (-X.XX): <explanation>

**V<N> strengths over V<M> (offset +W total):**
1. **<Label>** (+X.XX): <explanation>

**Net: ±X points compared to V<M>**
```

Every point deduction in Section 4 must appear here. The sum of all +/- must equal the gap.

### Section 7: Summary

One bullet or short paragraph per implementation. Focus on positioning:
- What niche does it fill? (cost-efficient, highest-quality, fastest, etc.)
- What is the primary differentiator from adjacent iterations?

### Section 8: Conclusions (optional, for iterative reports)

Two subsections:

1. **Achievements** — numbered list of what the latest iteration accomplished
2. **Regressions** — numbered list of what got worse compared to prior best

End with a "Remaining Gap to 100" table:

```markdown
| Gap | Points | Fix |
|-----|--------|-----|
| <weakness> | -X.XX | <proposed change to .ai/ files> |
```

### Section 9: Root-Cause Analysis (optional, for iterative reports)

For each weakness in the latest iteration, write:

```markdown
### Gap N: <Title> — **-X.XX points**

**Observed behavior:** <what the code does wrong>

**Root cause in `.ai/<file>`:** <which rule is missing, unclear, or unenforced>

**Fix required:**
<concrete change to the .ai/ file>
```

End with a summary table:

```markdown
| Gap | Points | Source file | Root cause | Proposed fix |
|-----|--------|-------------|------------|--------------|
```

## 4. Grading Methodology

### The Grade Scale

| Range | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 95–100 | Production-ready. All architecture rules followed. Full coverage. Clean process. |
| 90–94 | High quality. Minor style or process issues. No architectural violations. |
| 80–89 | Good. Some architectural gaps (missing VOs, leaky ports, incomplete coverage). |
| 70–79 | Competent. Correct output but significant architectural or testing gaps. |
| 60–69 | Functional. Works but violates multiple architecture rules. |
| Below 60 | Incomplete. Missing layers, broken tests, or incorrect output. |

### Point Deduction Scale

Deductions are applied to a base of 100. The sum of all deductions = 100 - grade.

| Severity | Points | Examples |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Critical | -5 to -15 | Incorrect output, broken tests, missing entire layer |
| Major | -2 to -5 | Anemic domain, leaky port, no test coverage on a layer, hidden dependencies |
| Moderate | -1 to -2 | Missing URL encoding, test suite mislabeling, dead code, commit bundling |
| Minor | -0.1 to -1 | FQN usage, non-final classes, cosmetic choices, session stalls |

### What to Evaluate (Checklist)

Score the implementation against these criteria. Each maps to a potential deduction:

**Architecture (max ~30 points at risk)**
- [ ] Domain uses Value Objects (not primitives) for domain concepts
- [ ] Domain classes are `final readonly` with validation in constructors
- [ ] Domain behavior lives on the entity/aggregate that owns the data
- [ ] Dependencies are explicitly injected (no hidden instantiation)
- [ ] Port interfaces don't expose transport concepts (URLs, headers)
- [ ] Port contracts use typed DTOs (not raw arrays)
- [ ] Exceptions that cross boundaries are defined at port level
- [ ] Application layer returns a DTO to presentation (no domain leakage)
- [ ] Output formatting is a separate concern from application logic
- [ ] Directory structure matches ARCHITECTURE.md

**Correctness (max ~15 points at risk)**
- [ ] Output matches expected behavior (byte-identical for refactoring)
- [ ] Known bugs are either fixed with justification or preserved with justification
- [ ] Edge cases are handled (empty input, overflow, missing data)

**Testing (max ~20 points at risk)**
- [ ] Coverage meets target (90% floor, 100% goal)
- [ ] Tests are deterministic (no network calls, no flakiness)
- [ ] Unit/Integration split is correct
- [ ] Named test doubles (no anonymous classes, no mocks unless necessary)
- [ ] Test naming follows `it_*` convention
- [ ] End-to-end smoke test exists
- [ ] Error paths are tested

**Infrastructure (max ~15 points at risk)**
- [ ] External data validated defensively (type-checks on every field)
- [ ] URL encoding applied to interpolated values
- [ ] HTTPS validation on URLs from API responses
- [ ] `json_decode` with error handling

**Code Style (max ~10 points at risk)**
- [ ] No FQN (use imports everywhere, source and test)
- [ ] All classes `final` (source and test)
- [ ] No `assert()` for runtime checks
- [ ] No dead production code
- [ ] Composer metadata correct

**Process (max ~10 points at risk)**
- [ ] Per-task commits (not bundled)
- [ ] Reviewer invoked per task
- [ ] Static analysis passes at max level with 0 errors
- [ ] Session stalls handled gracefully

## 5. Comparability Rules

To ensure reports can be compared across different implementations:

1. **Always use the same section structure** — sections 1–7 are mandatory; 8–9 are optional
2. **Always carry forward all prior grades** — Section 5 must include every iteration ever graded
3. **Always use the same deduction scale** — Minor: 0.1–1, Moderate: 1–2, Major: 2–5, Critical: 5–15
4. **Always reference ARCHITECTURE.md as the standard** — deductions are for violations of stated rules
5. **Always justify every point** — no deduction without a specific rule reference or observable symptom
6. **Grade the code as delivered, not as intended** — if a fix was planned but not applied, it's still a deduction
7. **Compare apples to apples** — when implementations use different plans, note this in Section 1 but grade against the same ARCHITECTURE.md standard
8. **Never grade on effort, session time, or LLM cost** — only on the quality of the delivered code
9. **Account for accepted trade-offs** — if the plan explicitly accepts a limitation (e.g., `file_get_contents`), reduce the deduction (cosmetic: -0.1 to -0.15) but still note it

---

## 6. Writing Tips

- **Be specific**: "8 occurrences of `\InvalidArgumentException` in test files" not "some FQN issues"
- **Be traceable**: reference line numbers, file paths, or rule citations
- **Be balanced**: every implementation has both strengths and weaknesses
- **Be concise**: bullets, not paragraphs. Tables, not prose where possible
- **Be fair**: the same violation in two implementations gets the same deduction
- **Be cumulative**: when a later iteration fixes a prior weakness, note it as a strength; when it introduces a new one, note it as a regression

---

## 7. Checklist Before Submitting

- [ ] All mandatory sections (1–7) present with correct numbering
- [ ] Section 2 table includes all implementations being compared
- [ ] Every deduction in Section 4 has a point value and rule reference
- [ ] Section 5 includes ALL iterations ever evaluated
- [ ] Section 6 point accounting sums to the exact gap between iterations
- [ ] Summary is concise (1–3 sentences per implementation)
- [ ] If iterative: Sections 8–9 present with gap-to-fix mapping
- [ ] Report is self-contained (reader doesn't need to open source code to understand findings)
- [ ] Grades are consistent with the deduction scale (deductions sum correctly)
