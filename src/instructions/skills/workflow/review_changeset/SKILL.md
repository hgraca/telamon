# Skill: Changeset Review

Systematic code review of changeset against architect's plan and project conventions.

## When to Apply

- After developer signals task completion and readiness for review
- When reviewing PR or code changeset before merge

## Review Workflow

Execute these steps in order before writing any review report.

### 0. Run Test Suite

Run test command. Record pass/fail, number of tests, failures. Failing tests are automatic BLOCKER. Complete remaining steps regardless.

### 1. Parameter & Argument Integrity

For every added or modified method:
- Verify every parameter used in method body. Flag parameters silently ignored in favour of hardcoded values.
- Verify call-site arguments match parameter's semantic intent, not just type.

### 2. Dead Code & Orphaned References

When class, method, or interface deleted or renamed:
- Search entire codebase for remaining references (DI bindings, config, architectural rules, baselines, routes, docs).
- Check for orphaned imports and dead container bindings.

### 3. Dependency Wiring Completeness

When constructor or factory signatures change:
- Verify all container bindings, registrations, and factories supply new parameters.
- Verify variadic/collection parameters wired, not silently defaulting to empty.
- Verify new bindings registered in component's own ServiceProvider, not in root AppServiceProvider (unless binding is cross-cutting). Component encapsulation requires each bounded context to own its wiring.

### 4. Import Hygiene

After any file modification:
- No unused imports remaining.
- No missing imports for newly referenced symbols.

### 5. Cross-file Rename Consistency

When any symbol renamed:
- Search all file types (source, config, YAML, JSON, TOML, Markdown, architectural rules, baselines).
- Verify references in comments, doc tags, and string-based references updated.

### 6. Test Assertion Completeness

For every added or modified test method:
- Verify every assertion matches what method name claims.
- Flag any test whose name states ordering, cardinality, or conditional but whose body only asserts existence or non-null.
- Example violation: name says "after" or "before" but body never compares positions.

**Test coverage regression check** — When existing test modified, compare set of assertions before and after:
- If assertions removed or narrowed (e.g. full-row content comparison reduced to header-only), flag as WARNING unless test name also updated to reflect reduced scope.
- Test named `amounts_are_converted_using_billing_rate` that no longer asserts anything about amounts or conversion is BLOCKER — test name makes promise body must keep.
- Fixture files (`*.csv`, `*.json`, `*.xml`, snapshot files) updated in changeset but no longer loaded by any test are dead fixtures — flag as WARNING and require deletion or re-use.
- Verify test classes do NOT import traits already provided by base TestCase (e.g. `RefreshDatabase` when base uses `LazilyRefreshDatabase`). Redundant traits can cause subtle behavior changes.

**Extension dependency guards** — When test uses functions from optional PHP extensions (`pcntl_*`, `posix_*`, `rdkafka_*`, `imagick_*`, etc.):
- Verify that `extension_loaded()` checks cover **all** required extensions, not just primary one. Test using both `pcntl_signal()` and `posix_kill()` must guard both `pcntl` and `posix` — flag missing guard as WARNING.
- Check for functions from secondary extensions easy to miss (e.g. `posix_kill`/`posix_getpid` alongside `pcntl_signal`).

**Global state restoration** — When test modifies global PHP process state (`pcntl_async_signals()`, `pcntl_signal()`, `ini_set()`, `putenv()`, `date_default_timezone_set()`, `error_reporting()`, or similar):
- Verify test captures previous value before modifying and restores in `finally` block.
- Bare restore at end of method body (not wrapped in `finally`) is WARNING — if test fails or throws, restore skipped and subsequent tests run with polluted global state.

**tearDown lifecycle safety** — When `tearDown()` or `tearDownAfterClass()` method performs multiple cleanup steps (e.g. calls external teardown, restores handler stacks, calls `parent::tearDown()`):
- Verify steps wrapped in nested `try/finally` blocks so every cleanup step runs even if earlier one throws.
- `parent::tearDown()` must be in innermost `finally` to guarantee PHPUnit's own cleanup always executes.
- `tearDown()` that calls external method (framework factory, application kernel, etc.) before other cleanup without `try/finally` is WARNING — if external call throws, remaining cleanup skipped and corrupted state cascades into subsequent tests.

### 7. Static Analysis Baseline Hygiene

When `phparkitect.baseline.json`, `phpstan-baseline.neon`, or any other static-analysis baseline file modified:
- Any new entry added is BLOCKER — architecture rule states baselines must not grow (see ARCHITECTURE.md "Do not add issues to static analysis tools baselines").
- Accept only removals. Require developer to fix violation or update architectural rule instead.

### 8. Decorator & Wrapper Integrity

When decorator or wrapper class forwards calls to inner dependency:
- Every parameter of decorated method MUST be forwarded — flag any silently dropped.
- When inner method's signature has de-facto convention parameters not declared in interface (e.g. `$index` on `Queue::pop()`), verify decorator forwards them so inner object's behaviour not silently broken.

### 9. State-Machine Reset Placement

When method maintains mutable state accumulating across calls and resets on condition:
- Verify reset fires on correct branch. Resetting on job-found path (early return) when intent is reset only on completion (null/empty path) is BLOCKER — discards state intentionally accumulated.
- Verify every caller path that should seed accumulator does so before it is consumed. Conditional seed (`if empty → seed`) that leaves accumulator stale when non-empty is BLOCKER.

### 10. Utility Method Abstraction Bypass

When method calls sibling method to reuse logic, verify sibling's internal invariants hold for every call sequence caller produces.
- If sibling has its own state machine, check that caller does not drive it into inconsistent state (e.g. pre-registering side-channel entries then consumed out of order).
- Prefer direct computation over indirect state manipulation when sibling's state machine not designed for external driving.

### 11. N+1 Query Regression

When changeset introduces bulk-load (e.g. `whereIn`, `with()`, eager loading) to avoid per-row queries:
- Search entire flow for any remaining call that lazily loads same relation on individual models (e.g. `$model->relation` inside loop, or called method that accesses `$model->relation` internally).
- Bulk-load that coexists with per-row lazy load of same relation in same pipeline is WARNING — optimization incomplete and N+1 queries still occur.
- Check called methods (not just inline code) — helper like `fromBillingTrip()` may load `$billingTrip->trip` even if handler pre-fetches trips separately.

### 12. `@phpstan-ignore` and Type-Masking

When `@phpstan-ignore` or `@phpstan-ignore-next-line` comment added or already present on modified code:
- Identify what error suppressed and whether indicates genuine type mismatch rather than PHPStan false positive.
- Under `strict_types=1`, passing `string` where `int` declared raises `TypeError` at runtime. Eloquent commonly returns numeric strings for integer columns when attribute lacks cast. Callback typed as `fn (int $id)` applied to plucked integer column is unsafe without cast — flag as WARNING and suggest `fn (string|int $id): T => new T((int) $id)`.
- `@phpstan-ignore` that hides real type mismatch rather than PHPStan false positive is WARNING, not acceptable suppression.

### 13. Primitive Obsession in Commands & Boundaries

When command, query, or controller added or modified:
- Verify constructor parameters use Value Objects when one exists in domain (e.g. `UserId` not `int`, `HotelId` not `int`, `Mailbox[]` not `string[]`).
- Verify controller `authorize()` calls pass VOs to policies, not raw primitives, when VO already constructed in controller.
- Verify policy methods accept corresponding VO type, not primitive.
- Command accepting raw primitive when domain VO exists for that concept is WARNING.

### 14. Hardcoded Configuration Values

When application or domain layer handlers added or modified:
- Flag hardcoded URLs, hostnames, ports, API keys, or environment-dependent strings. These should be injected via constructor + config binding (`giveConfig` or similar).
- Hardcoded values that vary per environment (dev/staging/prod) are WARNING — they break deployment flexibility and testability.
- Pure domain constants (e.g. mathematical formulas, enum values) are not configuration and should remain inline or as class constants.

### 15. Magic Values — Use Class Constants

When handler, service, or domain class uses literal numbers or strings with domain meaning:
- Flag inline magic numbers (e.g. TTL durations, retry counts, thresholds) and magic strings (e.g. email subjects, status labels) that should be class constants.
- Class constants make intent explicit, enable reuse, and simplify testing.
- Magic value used in more than one place is WARNING. Single-use magic value with non-obvious meaning is INFO.

### 16. Kubernetes Manifest Consistency

When changeset includes Kubernetes YAML manifests (any file with `apiVersion` and `kind`):
- When multiple resources share same `apiVersion`/`kind`, verify they have consistent ArgoCD annotations (`sync-wave`, `sync-options`). Inconsistent annotations across resources of same kind is WARNING.
- When resource uses Custom Resource `apiVersion` (not core `v1`, `apps/v1`, `batch/v1`, `networking.k8s.io/v1`, etc.), verify it has `argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: SkipDryRunOnMissingResource=true` if CRD installed by another Application in same changeset. Missing this annotation causes ArgoCD dry-run failures on first sync — flag as WARNING.
- When `kustomization.yaml` exists in same directory as new resource file, verify new file listed in `resources:`. Unlisted resource in Kustomize-managed directory will not be synced — flag as BLOCKER.

### 17. PSR-3 Exception Logging

When `catch` block logs via PSR-3 logger method (`->warning()`, `->error()`, `->critical()`, `->alert()`, `->emergency()`):
- Verify context array includes `'exception' => $catchVariable`. PSR-3 spec reserves `'exception'` key so log handlers can extract full stack trace — without it, only message string captured.
- Missing exception object in `->warning()` or `->error()` call inside catch block is WARNING.
- Catch block that logs `$e->getMessage()` but omits `'exception' => $e` is most common pattern to flag.

### 18. PHP Error Suppression Operator

When `@` operator used on any function or method call:
- Flag as WARNING — `@` operator suppresses all PHP errors indiscriminately, hiding potentially important warnings and making debugging difficult.
- Require targeted `set_error_handler`/`restore_error_handler` pair in `try/finally` block instead, so only expected warnings suppressed and unexpected ones remain observable.
- Only acceptable use of `@` is on trivially safe operations where failure immediately checked (e.g. `@unlink()` followed by existence check).

### 19. Log Level Appropriateness

When log statement added or modified in method called repeatedly (worker loops, per-request handlers, queue consumers, scheduled tasks):
- Verify log level appropriate for call frequency. `info` or higher in hot path that fires every iteration generates high-volume logs and cost.
- Routine "nothing happened" messages (e.g. partition empty, no work found, heartbeat) should be `debug` level — flag `info`+ as WARNING.
- Actionable events (message received, error encountered, retry triggered) appropriate at `info` or higher.
