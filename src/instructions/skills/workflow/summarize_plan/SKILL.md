# Skill: Planning Summary

Produce structured summary report at end of planning stage.

## When to Apply

- `plan` workflow reaches its summary step
- Orchestrator completes planning stage and needs to summarize artifacts, decisions, and next steps

## Procedure

1. Read all artifacts in `<issue-folder>` (backlog, architecture specs, critic reviews, UI/UX specs, decisions).
2. Fill in every section of template below — do NOT invent custom format.
3. Write result to `<issue-folder>/summary.md`. After writing, run `format-md` on file to align table columns.
4. Output summary to human stakeholder, as properly formatted Markdown.

## Template

> # Planning Complete — Summary Report
>
> # Issue: Replace scripts and raw K8s manifests with Helm charts
>
> ## Technology Choice
>
> _(If plan involved choosing between competing technologies, summarize evaluation here FIRST. Include: candidates, comparison table, decision rationale, when rejected alternatives would be right. If no technology choice made, omit this section.)_
