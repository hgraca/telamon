# Thinking -- Scratch Files & Drafts

All ephemeral scratch files, notes, drafts, or WIP content produced during session (not formal artifact) must be saved to `<proj>/.ai/telamon/memory/thinking/`. Do not create temporary ad-hoc files elsewhere.

## When to Apply

- Creating any temporary file, ephemeral note, draft, or WIP content
- Saving partial-progress checkpoints before context overflow
- Deciding whether to promote or delete existing scratch files

## 1. Naming

| Content                     | Filename                                |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| General scratch / draft     | `<descriptive-name>.md`                 |
| Partial-progress checkpoint | `YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM:SS-<task>-partial.md` |

## 2. Lifecycle

After task completes or session ends:

1. **Promote**: If file contains lasting value (decision, pattern, gotcha), move content to appropriate latent/ note.
2. **Delete**: Remove files that add no lasting value.
3. **Flag**: Any `thinking/` file older than 7 days should be reviewed -- promote or delete.

See `telamon.memory_management` skill (section 7) for full lifecycle rules.
