# Memory Management — Vault Structure & Rules

Canonical reference for all `.ai/telamon/memory/` vault operations. Other memory skills reference this skill for structure, routing, and quality rules.

## When to Apply

- Deciding where to save knowledge
- Formatting memory entries
- Auditing vault structure or latent note quality
- When another memory skill references vault rules

## 1. Vault Structure

```
.ai/telamon/memory/
  bootstrap/                 <- always-on context (loaded like AGENTS.md)
  latent/
    PDRs/                    <- product decisions, stakeholder answers (one file per item)
    ADRs/                    <- architecture/technical decisions (one file per item)
    global/                  <- lessons reusable across projects (one file per item)
      <technology>/          <- see Section 2 for full bucket list and classification rules
    project/                 <- lessons specific to this project (one file per item)
  work/
    active/                  <- in-progress work notes (3 issues max)
    archive/YYYY/MM/DD       <- completed work notes by year/month/day
    incidents/               <- incident docs
  reference/                 <- architecture maps, flow docs, codebase knowledge
  thinking/                  <- scratchpad for drafts (promote or delete)
```

Each `latent/` file is a standalone `.md` with YAML frontmatter (`date`, `keywords`, and optionally `see`). Body starts after frontmatter — no metadata in body.

## 2. Routing Table

| Content                                         | Destination                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Agent bootstrap instructions (always-on)        | `bootstrap/`                                      |
| Product decision + rationale                    | `latent/PDRs/` (new file per item, see section 5) |
| Human stakeholder answer to project question    | `latent/PDRs/` (new file per item)                |
| New rule from stakeholder                       | `latent/PDRs/` (new file per item)                |
| Architecture or technical decision + rationale  | `latent/ADRs/` (new file per item)                |
| Lesson reusable across projects (tech-specific) | `latent/global/<technology>/` (new file per item) |
| Lesson specific to this project                 | `latent/project/` (new file per item)             |
| In-progress work note                           | `work/active/`                                    |
| Completed work note                             | `work/archive/YYYY/`                              |
| Incident doc                                    | `work/incidents/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`             |
| Architecture map or flow doc                    | `reference/`                                      |
| Draft or reasoning scratchpad                   | `thinking/` (promote or delete, see section 7)    |
| Partial-progress checkpoint                     | `thinking/YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM:SS-<task>-partial.md`  |

**Routing rules:**
- Create a new file per item — never append to existing files
- File name: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-NN-<max-10-word-subject>.md` (timestamp = item date, NN = sequence within same second)
- Include YAML frontmatter: `date`, `keywords` (1–5 focused terms — tool names, concept names, domain terms)
- One entry per insight
- Include dates in entries

**global/ vs project/ decision rule:**
- `global/<tech>/` — lesson applies to the technology/tool regardless of project (e.g. a Docker gotcha, a Laravel pattern, a shell trick). Another project using the same tech would benefit.
- `project/` — lesson is specific to this project's domain, architecture, or conventions. Not useful elsewhere.
- **Specificity rule**: when content fits two buckets, the more specific wins (e.g. `laravel` beats `php`; `argocd` beats `k8s`; `kafka` beats `java`; `bun` beats `javascript`; `signoz` beats `otel`).
- **Classification signals** — match against filename + title + body (first match wins):

| Bucket       | Match when content mentions…                                                                |

If no technology bucket fits, use `project/`.

## 3. Retrieval Rules

- bootstrap/ loads automatically at session start — do not re-read
- latent/ files: use QMD semantic search for all categories — do NOT read entire folders
  - Use `search-memories` tool with relevant query terms
  - QMD returns file content with frontmatter stripped (data only)
  - Read specific files directly only when you know the exact filename
- All other files: search before read; max 3 non-latent notes per task; discard results with relevance score < 0.6

## 4. Writing Constraints

- Every note must link to at least one existing note via `[[wikilink]]` -- orphan note == bug
- When a PDR has a related ADR (or vice versa), add the related file's path to the `see` frontmatter array in **both** files. Example: a PDR defining a product rule and an ADR specifying how to implement it should each list the other in their `see` arrays.
- Never write: secrets, API keys, passwords
- Never write: files in vault root (only subfolders)
- Never write: agent instructions outside `bootstrap/` expecting auto-load

## 5. Latent Note Quality Criteria

| Folder          | Good entry has                                                   |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PDRs/`         | Decision + rationale (not just decision)                         |
| `ADRs/`         | Decision + rationale (not just decision)                         |
| `global/<tech>` | Reusable across projects; tech-specific; actionable with context |
| `project/`      | Project-specific; includes domain/architecture context           |

## 6. Latent Item File Format

All latent items are standalone `.md` files. File naming: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-<slug>.md`
- Timestamp: date of the item (`HHMMSS` = `000000` when only date known)
- Slug: max 10 words, hyphen-separated, lowercase, no special chars

### ADRs/ and PDRs/ — `keywords` frontmatter, single `##` body

Location: `latent/ADRs/` or `latent/PDRs/` inside the project vault.

```markdown
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
keywords: ["keyword1", "keyword2"]
see: ["PDRs/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-related-decision.md", "ADRs/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-related-adr.md"]
---

## <Decision title>

<One-paragraph description of the decision, what changed, why, and any constraints or caveats.>
```

- `keywords`: 1–5 focused terms (tool names, concept names, domain terms). Always include the primary tool/domain as first keyword.
- `see`: optional array of paths relative to the `latent/` root pointing to related latent memories. Use to cross-link a PDR with the ADR that implements it, or an ADR with the PDR that motivated it. Omit the key when there are no related memories.
- Body: single `##` heading + one prose paragraph. No sub-sections.

### global/<tech>/ — `keywords` frontmatter, single `##` body

Location: `storage/memory/global/<tech>/` (accessed via `latent/global/<tech>/` symlink in each project vault). Use for lessons reusable across projects — the tech bucket determines the subfolder (see section 2 classification table).

```markdown
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
keywords: ["<tech>", "keyword2"]
---

## <Title>

<One-paragraph description of the lesson — what the trap/pattern/rule is, why it matters, and how to apply or avoid it. Self-contained: no references to other files needed to act on this.>
```

- `keywords`: first keyword MUST be the bucket name (e.g. `"bun"`, `"argocd"`). 1–5 terms total.
- Body: single `##` heading + one prose paragraph. No sub-sections.
- **Do not** add `[[wikilinks]]` — global files are shared across projects and cannot reference project-specific notes.

### project/ — `tags` frontmatter, `#` title, multiple `##` sections

Location: `latent/project/` inside the project vault. Use for lessons specific to this project's domain, architecture, or conventions.

```markdown
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
keywords: ["keyword1", "keyword2"]
---

# <Title>

<Body. Use multiple ## sections as needed. Be specific and actionable.>
```

- `keywords`: 1–5 focused terms (tool names, concept names, domain terms). Always include the primary tool/domain as first keyword.
- Body: single `##` heading + one prose paragraph. No sub-sections.

### Entry quality rules (all formats)
- **Specific, not generic** — "Always pass `--no-interaction` to Artisan" not "Be careful with CLI commands"
- **Self-contained** — future agents need to understand *why* without reading other files
- **No scaffolding** — no `- **Date**: ...`, `- **Status**: ACTIVE`, `- **Scope**: ...` lines in body

### Pruning (when global/<tech>/ or project/ exceeds 100 files)
- Mark entries as `SUPERSEDED` (note the superseding file name) when newer entry replaces them
- Delete superseded files after one more session
- Review files older than 6 months for continued relevance
- Only orchestrator or human stakeholder may remove files

## 7. Thinking/ Lifecycle

### Promote or discard
For each file in `thinking/`:
- Contains reusable lesson -> promote to latent/, then **delete**
- Completed work -> **delete**
- Still live WIP -> keep; rename to `partial-<task>-YYYY-MM-DD.md` if not descriptive

### Hygiene
- Flag any `thinking/` file older than 7 days for user review
- Partial-progress notes use: `YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM:SS-<task>-partial.md`

### Watermark
Session capture tracks progress via `.ai/telamon/memory/thinking/.last-capture-<worktree-dirname>.json`. Only content after watermark timestamp needs processing.

## 8. Wrap-Up (on "wrap up" / "wrapping up")

1. Promote session learnings to appropriate `latent/global/<tech>/` or `latent/project/` folder (new file per item)
2. Archive completed `work/active/` notes -> `work/archive/YYYY/`
3. Verify every new vault note has at least one `[[wikilink]]`
4. Tell user what was promoted and saved

## 9. Memory Tiers (reference)

| Tier             | Store            | Content                                                      | Writer                                        |
|------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Long term active | bootstrap/ notes | Active memories, always loaded                               | Human                                         |
| Long-term latent | latent/ notes    | Architectural decisions, domain knowledge, patterns, gotchas | Agent at wrap-up, human for strategy          |
| Temporary        | thinking/ notes  | temporary files                                              | Agent when it needs a temporary file location |
