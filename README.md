# Agentic Development Kit (ADK)

> Everything a developer needs to get the best out of LLMs and coding agents — installed once, shared across every project.

---

## Overview

The ADK is a **local infrastructure kit** that installs, wires up, and manages a suite of AI-augmentation 
tools for software development. It provides:

- **Persistent agent memory** — the agent remembers decisions, bugs, and patterns across sessions and projects
- **Codebase understanding** — semantic code search and a structural knowledge graph
- **Curated knowledge vault** — human-readable notes that survive model resets
- **Session recall** — searchable history of every past agent conversation
- **Automatic session capture** — learnings are promoted to memory before context is compacted
- **Token efficiency** — automatic compression of context sent to the LLM

All tools run locally. No data leaves your machine.

---

## Tools

### Tier 1 — Highest ROI
- [Ogham MCP](https://ogham-mcp.dev) + Postgres + Ollama
  The single biggest gain for multi-project work. Large codebases accumulate years of tribal knowledge,
  without persistent memory the agent rediscovers all of it every session.
- Intelephense LSP
  Already built into OpenCode, zero extra setup.
  Real-time diagnostics mean the agent catches type errors, undefined methods, and wrong signatures
  inline rather than running the code to find out. For specifically this matters more than most languages
  because's type system is optional — without LSP the agent guesses a lot.
- AGENTS.md per project
  A well-written AGENTS.md with your stack versions, framework conventions, database patterns,
  and key contacts is worth more than any indexing tool on a project the agent hasn't seen before.

### Tier 2 — High value, worth the setup cost
- [Graphify](https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify)
  Particularly valuable for large legacy codebases where nobody has a complete mental model anymore.
  God nodes alone — knowing which classes everything routes through — prevents the agent from making changes in the wrong place.
  The OpenCode plugin means it fires automatically. One upfront LLM cost, then git hooks keep it current.
- [RTK](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk)
  Removes useless tokens from commonly used cli tools output.
  Highest ROI for token efficiency — zero config, immediate, compounds with all other tools
- [opencode-codebase-index](https://github.com/Helweg/opencode-codebase-index)
  Complements Graphify. Graphify tells you the structure, codebase-index lets you find code by meaning.
  "Find all places we handle currency conversion" works even if the functions aren't named obviously.
  Each project gets its own local index.

### Tier 3 — Useful
- [Cass](https://github.com/dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search)
  Uses the history of past sessions to draw from.
- [Obsidian MCP](https://hub.docker.com/r/oleksandrkucherenko/obsidian-mcp) & [Obsidian Mind](https://github.com/breferrari/obsidian-mind?tab=readme-ov-file)
  High value if you actually maintain notes. If nobody writes docs it adds nothing.
- Specialized agents
  The gains from routing planning to a smarter model and execution to a cheaper one compound with project size.

### 🧠 Ogham MCP — Semantic Agent Memory
[ogham-mcp](https://github.com/ogham-mcp/ogham-mcp)

Stores and retrieves decisions, bugs, and patterns using semantic vector search. 
Backed by a local **Postgres + pgvector** database and **Ollama** embeddings (`nomic-embed-text`). 
Exposed to the agent via an MCP server.

- Persists knowledge across sessions and projects using named profiles
- Searches by meaning, not exact text
- FlashRank cross-encoder reranking improves result precision (~+8pp MRR)

**Agent commands:** `ogham use <profile>`, `ogham store "..."`, `ogham search "..."`, `ogham hooks recall`, `ogham hooks inscribe`

---

### 🗺️ Graphify — Codebase Knowledge Graph
[graphify](https://github.com/graphifyy/graphifyy)

Builds a structural knowledge graph of the codebase. Identifies god nodes, architectural layers, call relationships, and module boundaries. 
Maintained automatically via git hooks after the initial build.

- Built once with `graphify .`; git hooks keep it current after every commit
- `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` is the entry point for architectural context
- Query with `graphify query "<question>"`

---

### 🔍 Codebase Index — Semantic Code Search
[opencode-codebase-index-mcp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opencode-codebase-index-mcp)

Indexes the project's source code using Ollama embeddings, enabling natural-language semantic search over the codebase. 
Built once per project; a file watcher maintains it automatically.

- Ask naturally: *"find the authentication logic"*, *"where is the payment handler?"*
- Results ranked by semantic similarity
- Exposed as an MCP tool (`index_codebase` / `search_codebase`)

---

### 📚 Obsidian MCP — Curated Knowledge Vault
[obsidian-mcp](https://github.com/oleksandrkucherenko/obsidian-mcp)

Bridges the agent to an **Obsidian** vault containing long-lived, human-curated knowledge: 
project goals, architectural decisions, codebase patterns, and known gotchas. 
Each project gets its own vault subfolder. Files in `bootstrap/` are **always loaded into context** — their content is available to the agent as if it were written directly in `AGENTS.md`.

```
<project>/bootstrap/       ← always-on context (treated as part of AGENTS.md)
<project>/brain/
  memories.md      ← index of memory topics
  key_decisions.md ← architectural decisions with rationale
  patterns.md      ← established codebase conventions
  gotchas.md       ← traps, constraints, known issues
<project>/work/
  active/          ← in-progress work notes
  archive/         ← completed work notes
  incidents/       ← incident docs
<project>/reference/  ← architecture maps, flow docs
<project>/thinking/   ← scratchpad for drafts
```

Obsidian must be installed separately (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)).

---

### 🗂️ cass — Agent Session History Search
[cass](https://github.com/dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search)

Indexes past agent session conversations and makes them full-text searchable. 
Useful for recovering context from previous sessions: *"what did we decide about the payment flow last week?"*

- Built once with `cass index --full`; a **post-commit git hook** installed by `make init` runs `cass index` incrementally after every commit to keep the index current
- Search with `cass search --robot "<topic>"` (the `--robot` flag is required — bare `cass search` launches a blocking interactive TUI)

---

### 📸 Session Capture — Automatic Memory Promotion

An OpenCode plugin that fires before every context compaction and on explicit wrap-up. 
It promotes session learnings to the vault's `brain/` notes and Ogham automatically — no manual intervention needed.

- **Pre-compaction hook**: runs before the LLM generates a compaction summary; ensures nothing is lost when the context window shrinks
- **Wrap-up trigger**: say *"wrap up"* to run a full capture pass at any time
- **Per-worktree watermark**: tracks what has already been captured so concurrent agents in different git worktrees don't duplicate entries
- Routes content to the right destination automatically: decisions → `key_decisions.md`, patterns → `patterns.md`, bugs → `gotchas.md`, etc.

---

### ⚡ RTK — Token Compression Proxy
[rtk](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk)

Transparently compresses bash command output before it reaches the LLM, reducing token consumption and cost. 
Installed as an opencode plugin that auto-patches shell commands.

- Installed globally and wired into opencode automatically (`rtk init -g --opencode --auto-patch`)
- No configuration needed; works transparently

---

### 🪨 Caveman — Token-Efficient Communication Mode
[caveman](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman)

A skill that switches the agent into an ultra-compressed communication mode — ~75% token reduction while keeping full technical accuracy. Useful for long sessions or when you want brief, direct answers.

- Activate by saying *"caveman mode"*, *"less tokens"*, or `/caveman`
- Supports intensity levels: `lite`, `full` (default), `ultra`, `wenyan-lite`, `wenyan-full`, `wenyan-ultra`
- Automatically drops filler, articles, and pleasantries; technical terms and code blocks are unchanged
- Deactivate with *"stop caveman"* or *"normal mode"*

---

### 🐋 Infrastructure Services (Docker)

| Service | Image | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ogham-postgres` | `pgvector/pgvector:pg17` | Vector database for Ogham memory |
| `adk-ollama` | `ollama/ollama:latest` | Local embedding model server |
| `adk-ollama-init` | `ollama/ollama:latest` | One-shot job: pulls `nomic-embed-text` on first start |

> **Obsidian MCP** runs on-demand via `docker run` (not a persistent service) so it does not crash when Obsidian is not running.

---

## Developer Workflow

### 1. One-time: Clone and start the ADK

```bash
git clone <this-repo> ~/adk
cd ~/adk
make up
```

`make up` will:
1. Copy `.env.dist` → `.env` (if not present)
2. Install prerequisite host tools (Homebrew, Docker) — `--pre-docker` phase
3. Start Docker services (`postgres`, `ollama`)
4. Install remaining tools (opencode, Ogham, Graphify, cass, RTK, codebase-index, Obsidian MCP) — `--post-docker` phase

If `.ai/adk/adk.ini` exists with `project_name` set, the installer reads it silently (no prompts for project name/profile). If `.env` already has `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` set, the password prompt is also skipped.

> The installer is **idempotent** — safe to re-run at any time. Already-installed tools are skipped.

---

### 2. One-time per project: Initialise

```bash
make init PROJ=path/to/your-project
```

This will:
- Create the full Obsidian vault at `storage/obsidian/<project-name>/` with:
  - `bootstrap/` (always-on context files)
  - `brain/` notes (`memories.md`, `key_decisions.md`, `patterns.md`, `gotchas.md`)
  - `work/active/`, `work/archive/`, `work/incidents/` folders
  - `reference/` and `thinking/` folders
- Symlink `<project>/.opencode/skills/adk` → `<adk-root>/src/skills` (agent skills)
- Write `<project>/.ai/adk/adk.ini` with the project name variable
- Install the **Graphify** git hook and OpenCode plugin in the project
- Install the **session-capture** OpenCode plugin in the project (auto-captures before compaction)
- Install the **cass** post-commit git hook in the project (incremental index after every commit)

After this, when `opencode` starts in the project, it automatically loads the ADK context and skills.

---

### 3. Every day: Start the ADK

```bash
cd ~/adk
make up       # if not already running
```

Check status at any time:

```bash
make status    # quick installation status
make doctor    # comprehensive health check (connectivity, secrets, config)
```

---

### 4. Every agent session: Memory bootstrap

At the start of every session the agent (via the `memory-stack` skill) will:

```bash
ogham use <project-name>     # activate this project's memory profile
ogham hooks recall            # surface relevant past context
```

Then check and build (once each, if missing):
- Graphify knowledge graph: `graphify .`
- Codebase index: `index_codebase` tool
- cass index (first time only): `cass index --full`

---

### 5. During work

The agent automatically:
- Searches Ogham before repeating known work: `ogham search "<topic>"`
- Searches the codebase semantically via the codebase-index MCP
- Queries Graphify for architectural context: `graphify query "<question>"`
- Searches past sessions when needed: `cass search --robot "<topic>"`
- Reads `brain/NorthStar.md` to stay aligned with goals

---

### 6. Saving knowledge

The agent saves to **both** Ogham (fast semantic recall) and Obsidian `brain/` (human-readable, curated):

| Event | Ogham | Obsidian |
|---|---|---|
| Non-trivial bug fixed | `ogham store "bug: <desc>"` | Append to `brain/Gotchas.md` |
| Architectural decision | `ogham store "decision: X over Y because Z"` | Append to `brain/KeyDecisions.md` |
| Pattern established | `ogham store "pattern: <desc>"` | Append to `brain/Patterns.md` |
| Session ends | `ogham hooks inscribe` | Archive completed `work/active/` notes |

The **session-capture plugin** handles this automatically before every compaction. On explicit wrap-up it also presents a summary of what was saved.

---

### 7. Wrap-up

When you say *"wrap up"* the agent will:
1. Promote session learnings to `brain/` notes
2. Archive completed `work/active/` notes to `work/archive/YYYY/`
3. Run `ogham hooks inscribe` to save the session summary
4. Report what was saved

> This also runs automatically before every context compaction via the session-capture plugin.

---

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Linux** (Ubuntu/Debian/Mint) or **macOS** | Apple Silicon and Intel both supported |
| **Docker** | Installed automatically if missing |
| **Obsidian** | Install manually from [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md); enable the *Local REST API* community plugin; copy the API key |
| **opencode** | The AI coding agent this ADK augments — [opencode.ai](https://opencode.ai) |

---

## Configuration

Copy `.env.dist` to `.env` (done automatically by `make up`) and set:

```bash
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
OBSIDIAN_API_KEY=your-obsidian-local-rest-api-key
```

The Obsidian API key comes from: *Obsidian → Settings → Community Plugins → Local REST API → API Key*.
